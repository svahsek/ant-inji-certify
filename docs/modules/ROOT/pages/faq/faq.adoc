=== Segregation of eSignet VCI Component to Inji Certify

Inji Certify, a platform for issuing and managing verifiable credentials (VCs), has enhanced its system by segregating the eSignet VCI component. This strategic move optimizes functionality and scalability.

Important Update: Now eSignet VCI is known as Inji Certify Core!

==== What was eSignet VCI?

_eSignet VCI_ was a microservice for secure authentication, issuance, and verification of VCs, based on OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols. It ensures reliable user authentication and promotes interoperability across systems.

==== Reasons for Segregation

_1. Enhanced Specialization and Focus_

* Separating eSignet VCI allows Inji Certify to focus on credential issuance while eSignet VCI concentrates on secure authentication and verification, improving efficiency.

_2. Improved Scalability_

* Each component can now scale independently based on demand, ensuring the platform handles varying loads effectively.

_4. Streamlined Maintenance and Updates_

* Independent updates and maintenance reduce downtime and allow for quicker deployment of enhancements and security patches.

_5. Facilitating Multi-Tenancy_

* The segregation will support multiple issuers on a single Inji Certify instance, ensuring data integrity and security for each issuer in the upcoming implementation of Inji Certify.

==== _How the Segregation Works_

_ _Modular Structure*: Now eSignet VCI is maintained as a separate module within the Inji Certify which offers an Inji Certify core under the Certify repository, ensuring a clear separation of concerns while maintaining a unified codebase.
_ _Enhanced Configuration*: Organizations can now configure Inji Certify core which offers the VC issuances independently to meet specific requirements, allowing for customized solutions.

The segregation of eSignet VCI enhances Inji Certifyâ€™s performance and scalability, providing a robust solution for issuing and managing verifiable credentials. This strategic move ensures a more secure and efficient credentialing ecosystem for organizations and users.

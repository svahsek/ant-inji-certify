=== Generation and Signing of Verifiable Credentials

Inji Certify simplifies the creation of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) by enabling organizations to effortlessly generate and digitally sign them. This process ensures the authenticity and trustworthiness of each credential. By employing robust digital signatures, Inji Certify safeguards VCs against tampering and enables swift and reliable verification, enhancing trust and security for both issuers and recipients.

_ _Intuitive Credential Definition*: Easily define the structure and data fields of various credential types, such as diplomas, licenses, and certifications, through a user-friendly interface.
_ _Data Integration*: Seamlessly integrate with existing databases and systems to automatically populate credential data, reducing manual entry and minimizing errors.
_ _Secure Key Management*: Leverage robust cryptographic techniques and secure key management practices to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of issued credentials.
_ _Efficient Signing Process*: Efficiently sign credentials using digital signatures, ensuring their authenticity, integrity, and tamper-proof nature.
  * Inji Certify now offers enhanced cryptographic flexibility through support for additional signing algorithms:
  _ _ECC K1 2019 Key Support*: Inji Certify supports signing and verification using ECC K1 2019 keys, enabling compatibility with a broader range of secure systems and ensuring robust security for verifiable credentials.
  _ _Ed25519 Signing (2018 & 2020)*: Verifiable credential requests can now be signed using Ed25519 keys, compliant with both 2018 and 2020 specifications. This enhancement ensures interoperability with diverse ecosystems and aligns with modern cryptographic standards.

=== Interoperability

Inji Certify prioritizes interoperability by adhering to industry standards, specifically the OpenID specifications (OpenID4VCI Draft 13). This ensures that the generated Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are compatible with a wide range of systems and platforms that also support these standards. This interoperability offers several key advantages:

_ _Seamless integration*: VCs generated by Inji Certify can be easily integrated into existing systems and workflows, minimizing the need for complex integrations or custom development.
_ _Wider adoption*: By adhering to widely recognized standards, Inji Certify facilitates the broader adoption and usage of VCs across various industries and applications.
_ _Improved data exchange*: Interoperability enables seamless data exchange between different systems and organizations, streamlining processes and improving efficiency.
_ _Increased trust and reliability*: Compliance with industry standards builds trust and reliability among users, as it ensures that VCs are compatible and can be verified across different platforms.

=== Plugin Support

Inji Certify supports the integration of custom plugins to enhance its flexibility and adaptability to diverse organizational needs. These plugins can be broadly categorized into two types:

. _VC Issuance Plugins_::

_VC Issuance Plugins_ are responsible for generating and signing Verifiable Credentials (VCs) themselves. They typically interact with external identity or authentication systems to obtain necessary information and then generate the VC in JSON-LD format.

_ _Current VC Issuance Plugins*:
  * Mock IDA Plugin
  * MOSIP Identity Plugin
  * Sunbird RC Plugin

. _Data Provider Plugins_:

_Data Provider Plugins_ fetch relevant data from external sources or registries. They retrieve the necessary information and return it to Inji Certify as a JSON object. Inji Certify then utilizes this data to generate and issue the corresponding VCs.

_ _Current Data Provider Plugins*:
  * Mock CSV Data Provider Plugin
  * Postgres Data Provider Plugin

Users can easily integrate custom plugins into the Inji Certify Registry by following the detailed instructions provided in the Inji Certify Repository's README file. This plugin architecture allows for seamless integration with various external systems and data sources, making Inji Certify a highly adaptable and customizable solution for diverse credentialing needs.

=== VC (Verifiable Credentials) formats which are supported

Inji Certify supports a variety of widely used credential formats, including:

_ _JSON-LD:* A standardized format for representing linked data, enabling seamless data exchange and interoperability across different systems.

==== VC (Verifiable Credentials) formats (Coming Soon)

_ _mDoc:* A mobile document format designed for secure and efficient storage and exchange of digital documents.
_ _mDL:* A mobile driver's license format that enables secure and convenient presentation of driver's licenses on mobile devices.
_ _Signed JWT (JWT):* A compact and self-contained format for securely transmitting claims between two parties, enhancing security and ease of use.

The support for multiple credential formats ensures compatibility with a wide range of applications and systems, catering to diverse data format requirements.

By expanding its support to include these emerging formats, Inji Certify will further enhance its interoperability and adaptability to future advancements in digital credentialing technologies.

=== Revocation Mechanism (Coming Soon)

Inji Certify includes a revocation mechanism to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of issued verifiable credentials (VCs):

_ _Revocation Mechanism*: Allows issuers to invalidate credentials that are no longer valid due to expiration, fraud, or changes in status.
_ _Revocation List*: Maintains a registry of revoked credentials.
_ _API Interfaces*: Provides Revocation API for issuers to revoke credentials and Verification API for third parties to check credential status.
_ _Discovery API*: Enables discovery of the revocation list to ensure verifications are based on the latest information.

=== Multi-Tenancy Model (Coming Soon)

Multiple issuers can be onboarded on a single instance of Inji Certify, allowing diverse data providers to manage and issue credentials within the same platform while ensuring data security and integrity.

==== Ease of Installation

_ _Streamlined Setup*: Simplifies installation with a single shell startup script connecting Docker-compose scripts.
_ _Helm Support*: Provides Helm support for deployment flexibility.
_ _User-Friendly*: Emphasizes ease of use, reducing complexity and deployment time.

Inji Certify streamlines the issuance of verifiable credentials with robust integration capabilities and a straightforward installation process. It supports multiple credential schemas and ensures compliance with industry standards, making it a versatile solution for organizations needing secure and efficient credential management.

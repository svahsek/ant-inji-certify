. _Setup:_ Configure InjiWeb and Mimoto in your local environment.
. _Issuer Configuration:_ Add an issuer in Mimoto with the authorization\_endpoint, credential\_endpoint, and .well-known properties pointing to the installed eSignet and Certify services.
. _Private Key Addition:_ Insert the private key from the OIDC client created in eSignet into the .p12 file in Mimoto.
. _Verification:_ The configured issuer should now appear on the InjiWeb homepage, allowing you to download the credential.
. _Plugin Compatibility:_ For this release, ensure that the eSignet image version in Docker Compose (currently 1.4.1) is consistent with the Mock plugin dependencies in Artifactory. This alignment is crucial due to shared Redis cache dependencies resolving serialization issues.
